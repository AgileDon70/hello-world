# hello-world
Example Repository - hotfix line 2! engineering a conflict!

Description: This read me file is being used to explore the basic functions of how github manages multiple edits and versions to files.  These incude branching, committing (check in), Pull request (merge request), and merging.  Issue to explore are conflicts, and other error states.

This is the new first line - I think you'll find it has improved!
This was the first edit of the file, now its the second
then there is the third line

I have now expanded the file to include this line
and this line too

thats enough for now,

signing off,

Don E.
